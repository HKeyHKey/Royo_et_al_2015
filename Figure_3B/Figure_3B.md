Tracing volcano plot with R:

``R CMD BATCH R_commands_deregulated_miRNAs_volcano_plot_37dpp``

N.B.: data appears too noisy for FDR adjustment (significant changes vanish, while they were cleanly restricted to BAC-linked miRNAs with raw p-values). FDR adjustment thus seems to be too harsh for this dataset.
